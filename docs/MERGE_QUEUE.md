# Merging through the queue

When `main` requires GitHub's native merge queue, a reviewed PR enters the queue
and its required checks run again against the candidate containing current
`main` and preceding queued changes. A green PR check run alone does not show
that this combined candidate passed.

After required PR checks pass, enqueue the reviewed revision with:

```sh
gh pr merge PR_NUMBER --repo CultureBotAI/MediaIngredientMech --match-head-commit HEAD_SHA
```

Enqueueing is asynchronous. Before deleting the branch or cleaning its worktree,
confirm `state` is `MERGED`, `headRefOid` equals the reviewed `HEAD_SHA`, and
`mergeCommit.oid` is present:

```sh
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --repo CultureBotAI/MediaIngredientMech --json state,headRefOid,mergeCommit
```

The queue selects the configured merge method. Avoid `--admin`, which bypasses
the queue. On failure, inspect the PR timeline and the `merge_group` Actions
run, fix the cause, and enqueue the updated revision after its PR checks pass.

The component-partonomy, duplicate-ID, evidence, flat-export, and SSSOM jobs have distinct check names. This prevents one QC result from being mistaken for another.

Required workflow triggers and stable job names are checked by
`tests/test_merge_queue_workflows.py`. Coordinate job renames with the `main`
ruleset so the queue continues receiving every expected result.
